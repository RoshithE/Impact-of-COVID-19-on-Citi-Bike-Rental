# Impact of COVID-19 on Citi Bike Rental
New york is one of the major cities in USA that has been dreadfully been affected by Covid-19 and New York state is slowly emerging from the shelter-in-place order issued on March 22 to prevent the spread of Covid-19.It remains to be seen just how long it will take for things to truly get back to normal. In the meantime, I thought it would be interesting to analyze bike rental data from 2019 and 2020 to see what effect, if any, the pandemic has had on NYC's bike share program.
